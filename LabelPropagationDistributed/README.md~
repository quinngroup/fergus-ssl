## Synopsis

A Label Propagation semi-supervised clustering algorithm based on the paper "**Semi-supervised Learning in Gigantic Image Collections**" by Fergus, Weiss and Torralba with modifications to fit Spark.  

## Code Example

```python
from LabelPropagationDistributed import LabelPropagationDistributed as LPD  
import numpy as np  
dataX = np.array([ 5.76961775,  -6.55673209, 11.30752027,  -1.56316985,8.76722337,  -1.54995049, 10.23511359,  -6.20912033,3.49161828,  -3.02917744]).reshape(5,2)  
dataY = np.array([ 1,  -1,  0, -1, -1])  
test = np.array([2.1159109 ,   6.03520684,   1.04347698,  -4.44740207,-8.33902404,   4.20918959]).reshape(3,2)  
testLabels = np.array([1, 0, 0])  
lpd = LPD(sc=sc, sqlContext = sqlContext, numBins = 2)  
lpd.fit(sc.parallelize(dataX),sc.parallelize(dataY))  
plabels_ = lpd.predict(sc.parallelize(test))  
```
## Motivation

The idea behind implementing this algorithm was to attempt classification of millions of Olfactory Compounds with only a few labeled compounds making it a semi-supervised problem.
Being a Spark compatible algorithm, millions of Olfactory data can be trained and tested with this model.  

## Installation

Pre-Requisites needed to be installed:  
Apache Spark 2.0  
Python 2.7.0  
numPy 1.8.2  
sciPy 0.14.1  
sklearn 0.18  


## API Reference

The proposed algorithm for semi-supervised clustering is based on the paper "Semi-supervised Learning in Gigantic Image Collections" by Fergus, Weiss and Torralba.
